# Python Flask-Based Coding Blog Webpage

## Overview

The **Python Flask-Based Coding Blog Webpage** is a platform where users can create, post, and manage their blogs, with all content securely stored in a MySQL database managed by Apache's phpMyAdmin. The site features a master dashboard that grants the admin full control over managing user posts and related operations. While users can log in, create, and update their posts, the admin has privileges to monitor, edit, or delete posts, ensuring smooth functionality and content oversight. The system supports multiple users and provides secure session management for both users and administrators.
